# Decisions log

Every locked decision with date and reason. Append-only; supersede rather than
delete. See `docs/project-context-master.md` §4 (non-negotiables) and §5
(locked decisions) for the authoritative source.

## 2026-09-02 — Locked decisions carried into the scaffold

| Decision | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Scorer model (Head B) | `ai-forever/mGPT`; fallback `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B` | Only multilingual causal LM with real Telugu coverage at a runnable size |
| Language buckets | `en`, `hi`, `te`, `cm` (Hinglish primarily) | Four separate calibrations, four fairness rows |
| Min calibration data | ≥ 1000 human texts per bucket, separate from train/test | Conformal quantile unstable below ~500 |
| Web layer | Django 5 + DRF, SQLite in dev | Admin = free audit interface; ORM = decision-evidence trail |
| Fusion | Logistic regression first; GBM only if it wins on cal AUROC | Interpretability is a feature |
| Seen generators | 3 open models via local Ollama (Llama-3-8B, Gemma-2-9B, Mistral-7B) | Free, reproducible |
| Held-out generators | 2 models, test only | Non-negotiable #4 |
| Adversarial attacks | Back-translation (IndicTrans2), LLM paraphrase, 20%-human-edited hybrids | Matches RAID/DetectRL practice |
| Real student data | Undecided; proxy corpora primary; go/no-go at week 6 | Approvals uncertain |

### Scaffold-time engineering decisions

- **`src/` third-party imports are guarded under `TYPE_CHECKING`** so the package
  imports with nothing installed (upholds non-negotiable #7: runs with Django
  uninstalled). Type hints (`np.ndarray`, etc.) still read correctly via
  `from __future__ import annotations`.
- **Migration `0001_initial` hand-authored** because Django was not installed at
  scaffold time; it matches `models.py` so a later `makemigrations` is a no-op.
- **App registered as `webapp.detector` with label `detector`** (app nested in the
  project package per §8).

## Decisions still open (fill as resolved)

- [ ] Phase 0.1 — what "patent" means (disclosure / IPR-cell / IPO provisional).
- [ ] Phase 0.2 — what "consultancy" means; internal client acceptable?
- [ ] Scorer lock — after the mGPT vs Qwen tokenizer-fertility test (Day 3).
- [ ] Head C — include only if host VRAM ≥ 8GB (`scripts/check_hardware.py`).
- [ ] Fusion — logistic vs GBM, decided on calibration AUROC.
- [ ] Paper venue — ICON / IEEE-Springer / journal fallback.
- [ ] Held-out generators — the two names to put in `configs/*.yaml`.
